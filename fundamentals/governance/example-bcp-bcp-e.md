# Example BCP - BCP#E

**Proposal Title:**

BCP#E - Create a 'Satoshi' backed token derivative.&#x20;

**Proposal Introduction:**

As you may already know, Bitcoin's currency $BTC is made up of 100,000,000 (One Hundred Million) 'satoshis' each and makes for a perfect high denomination - high frequency trade token for solana's orderbooks and markets.  Our example proposal (BCP#E) suggest the implementation of a satoshi backed SPL-Token allowing for a higher denominated bitcoin derivative on solana.

**Proposal Advantages (+EV):**

* Capture value from DeFi + CLMM/AMM integration + liquidity provision.&#x20;
* Its a large-denomination token with real underlying value ($BTC) making it perfect for incentivization.&#x20;
* encourages growth of the Bitcoin economy on the Solana Network, which in turn propogates BIMP's artefacts.&#x20;
* creates a solid value proposition for governance for BIMP artefacts.&#x20;
* has instant redemption & arbitrage value.&#x20;
* treasury can earn fees on people converting WBTC etc into SPL satoshis and back etc.
* allows BIMP's to potentially earn satoshis via lockups.

**Estimated Proposal Expenses:**

\-> Deployment of SPL-Token Contract via Governance = $1.00 or less.&#x20;

\-> Seeding $AT with 1.5 BTC equivalent to 150,000,000 tokens = 1.5 $BTC Rate (est $35,000)



**DATE:** 20/02/2023



**Additional Notes:**&#x20;

it would be based to earn satoshi's outside of mining, and to help grow the bitcoin economy on solana.&#x20;
