description: Governance Structure for BIMP Community Proposals.

# Structure

**Equal Voting Structure**

BIMP will initiate with one artefact equating to one vote in any proposal, opting not to use the council model and instead allowing the community to form the most efficient structure for them based on their initial conviction. If you feel more inclined to lead the direction of BIMP then you MUST hold the relevant artefacts.&#x20;

{% hint style="success" %}
1 BIMP = 1 VOTE
{% endhint %}

**Subject to Change**

As with any decentralised, governed system - the parameters are subject to change based on agreed upon proposals by the community. If the community so agrees to implement a council based strucutre, these documents will change to reflect that - and document via archive all of its previous changes.&#x20;
