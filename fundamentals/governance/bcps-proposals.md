# BCP's (Proposals)

BCP's or BIMP Community Proposals are a method of organizing the community to ensure continued contribution. Think of them like a simple vote, where any one holder of a BIMP artefact can initiate this vote. Every single holder acts as a founder, paving the way forward.&#x20;

_Perpetuating the underlying goal of securing more bitcoin and utilizing the community funds to grow the BIMP ecosystem and adoption._

**Fair Proposal Agreement (FPA)**

on-chain proposals are designed to reach "fair agreements" between a distributed group of individuals, thus it is important to take into consideration the relative wants, needs and expectations of people from different cultures and backgrounds. Furthermore taking into account the relative expense in comparison to return to the broader community - not just monetarily but in a broader sense.&#x20;
