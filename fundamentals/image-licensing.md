By applying the CC0 license, the 21.12 Foundation have waived all their rights to the works and placed them in the public domain. This means that anyone can use the "BIMP" brand, image and tokens for any purpose, including commercial use, without the need for permission or payment to the foundation.

This license grants anyone the right to use, copy, modify, and distribute the work for any purpose, and we encourage people to do so. CC0 is a way for the foundation to remove barriers to the use of their works and encourage collaboration and creativity by making their works widely and freely available. The license is often used for open data, scientific research, and other creative works that are intended to be shared and reused by others.
