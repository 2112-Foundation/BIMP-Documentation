# ðŸŸ¢ PoS Treasury (SOL)

The 21.12 Foundation designed the Solana release of Ordinal backed BIMP's so that the inbound funds from "mint" are routed to a DAO controlled treasury (see breakdown in artefact sector). This treasury is designated to yield $SOL and relative liquid-staking derivations in order to bridge and or acquire backed Satoshis on the Solana Network.&#x20;

All royalties, donations, profit and contributions are subject to routing to the above treasury. Our theory is that this supports and both accelerates the process of bridging more Bitcoin to Solana.&#x20;

**Creating a Trusted Governed Environment for Bitcoin on Solana**

We wanted to highlight an alternative approach to BTC on Solana, one whereby a trusted environment of 500 artefact collectors use governance to steward multi-sig custodied Bitcoin and issue a 1:1 backed derivative on Solana. The possibilities of usage of this derivative are endless should the multi-sig and 1:1 SPL grow large enough in size. A sustainable, long term approach.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
_note: by using multi-sig custody on bitcoin, and derivative governance via artefacts on Solana - we create a secure setup for a trusted governed environment._
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
There is NO current BTC derivative from 'BIMP'&#x20;
{% endhint %}
