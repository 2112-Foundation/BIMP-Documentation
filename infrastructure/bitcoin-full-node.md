# ðŸŸ  Bitcoin Full-Node

The 21.12 Foundation operates multiple initial Bitcoin Full-Nodes as part of the inscription process for BIMP digital artefacts and commits to continually operate these nodes as access to Bitcoin for everyone. But beyond the inscription process, a full-node is core infrastructure to the BIMP community for a few reasons:

* By running a full node, BIMP can help verify the authenticity of Bitcoin transactions and blocks, independently of third-party services or intermediaries. This can help protect the network from attacks or manipulation, and enhance the overall trust and confidence in the Bitcoin system.
* Provides BIMP with greater control and autonomy over its Bitcoin transactions. By running its own node, BIMP can avoid relying on centralized exchanges or other intermediaries to execute its transactions, reducing the risk of hacks, thefts, or other security breaches. It can also ensure that its transactions are processed in a timely and efficient manner, without having to rely on third-party services or incur additional fees.
* Earns Satoshis via the Lightning Routing System.&#x20;
* Inscribe more Satoshi's with BIMP Artefacts.
