# ðŸª¨ Artefact Standard

"Artefact" is an alternative standard for the Solana ecosystem, one with zero authority - designed to make collecting immutable digital artefacts a consistent and secure experience. It is based on the previously proposed standard "NFToken" by [Victor Pontis](https://twitter.com/VictorPontis) of Glow Wallet. You can read more about NFToken [here.](https://nftoken.so/docs/)

> The Artfact Program is a fork of the NFToken program designed with immutability as the core focus.&#x20;

**Core Properties of Artefact Program**

\-> It is <mark style="background-color:green;">4x cheaper</mark> than the metaplex program, allowing creators to mint an NFT for 2M lamports vs 10M lamports _(see_ [_nftoken docs_](https://nftoken.so/docs/)_)_&#x20;

_->_ 'artefacts' are incredibly simple - allowing developers to query and compose with ease.

_->_ <mark style="background-color:green;">Immutable by default,</mark> with no option otherwise - artefact is collector focused and targets long-term digital collectible pieces designed NOT to change.

\-> <mark style="background-color:green;">ossified program</mark> - artefact-program is deployed with no upgrade authority, is anchor verified, idl published and open source.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
**note:** _artefact-program CAN'T enforce royalties, while we support and encourage creators, we believe NFT's are truly owned by the collector in ALL aspects._&#x20;
{% endhint %}



**Why Artefacts?**

Non-Fungible Tokens (NFT's) on Solana currently lack clarity for its collectors, creators and traders alike - with a monolithic standard currently residing in the ecosystem the current approach has been to encourage broad discussion on changes this standard could make.&#x20;

We personally felt that no single "standard" can encompass every type of stakeholder without there always being contention on ownership, upgradeability, royalties and more. Thus we have decided to deploy "artefacts" a standard that is CLEAR from the start for collectors, creators and developers - immutability > everything.&#x20;

Artefact is not a standard for everything, it is a standard for immutable, permissionless digital collectibles designed to be AS IS forever. hence its name. By giving this clarity from the start, our theory is that over time more serious long-term collectors and creators will adopt.&#x20;
