# ðŸ‘‹ Introduction to BIMP

"BIMP's" are 512 provably unique **collectible artefacts** with _proof of ownership_ inscribed onto the **Bitcoin network.** BIMP's will live as part of the core archive for Bitcoin Nodes for _as long as the network persists._&#x20;

Each BIMP represents an 'ordinal' satoshi, a sub-denomination unit of Bitcoin's native currency $BTC. They we're created using Ordinal Theory to inscribe the 24x24 canvas artworks directly into blocks. To discover more about 'ordinal theory' click here.&#x20;

BIMP's were launched in Q1 2023.

We created BIMPs to represent the power of cross-chain denomination - leveraging the sovereignty of Bitcoin with the high-performance, high-throughput network "Solana". Our theory predicts Sovereign Digital Assets having cross-chain denominations in cluster groups known as trusted governance environments (TGE)&#x20;
